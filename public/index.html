  <p>Quality Threads is a clothing store that sells products distributed by other clothing manufacterers. The database driven website will record Sale Orders, Products, Customers, and Distributors. The company averages 50,000 Sales Orders per year to roughly 35,000 Customers. For every Sale Orders entity there is one Sale Order Products entity and at least one Products entity, so the database is expected to have ~200,000 entries. The data recorded on the website will allow users to track the orders of customers and the products of distributors. This would then provide a clear basis for any additional inventory needed. It is important that the clothing store is able to access sales information quickly and efficiently. The data will also provide insight as to what the demographics of their customers are, which is information that can be used to target uncreached segments of the market.</p>
