# Quality Threads Project Step 5 Draft Version

This draft webpage requires the database dump **qthreads.sql** to be setup *before* you can run the application. This involves filling in the dbcon.js file with your own MariaDB info.

Once the qthreads.sql database is setup, run `npm install` and `node main.js {port number}` on flipX, and use the URL: `https://flipX.engr.oregonstate.edu:{port number}` to open with the webpage.

The READ and CREATE functionalities are implemented on all entity pages.
